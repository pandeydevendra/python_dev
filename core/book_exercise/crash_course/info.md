>1. VARIABLES: Naming and Using Variables-
	•Variables can contain only letters(a-z), numbers(0-9), and underscores(_)
	•Can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number;viz: message_1 but not 1_message.
	•Spaces( ) are not allowed in variable names, but underscores(_) can be used to separate words in 
	 variable names. For example, greeting_message works, but greeting message will cause errors.
	•Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that 
	 Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word print . (See “Python Keywordsand Built-in Functions” on page 489.)
	•Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is better than n, 
	 student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.
	.Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.

Note:
	The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase. You won’t get errors if you use uppercase letters, 
	but it’s a good idea to avoid using them for now.
    @Avoiding Name Errors When Using Variables:
	Every programmer makes mistakes, and most make mistakes every day. Although good programmers might create errors, 
	they also know how to respond to those errors efficiently.

>2. STRINGS: 
	A string is simply a series of characters. Anything(numbers, alphabets, words etc) inside quotes is considered a string in Python, 
	>and you can use single or double quotes around your strings like this:
"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'
	This flexibility allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your strings:
'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'
"The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."
"One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community"

>>3. List:
	Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by
    telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired. To access an ele-
    ment in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item
    enclosed in square brackets.
	   In Python, square brackets ( [] ) indicate a list, and individual elements
    in the list are separated by commas. Here’s a simple example of a list that
    contains a few kinds of bicycles:
       Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1 for accessing the last element in a list. 
	By asking for the item at index -1 , Python always returns the last item in the list:

>>Adding Elements to a List; "Appending" Elements to the End of a List:
'''The simplest way to add a new element to a list is to append the item to the
list. When you append an item to a list, the new element is added to the end
of the list. Using the same list we had in the previous example, we’ll add the
new element 'ducati' to the end of the list:'''
>>The append() method adds 'ducati' to the end of the list without affecting any of the other elements in the list:
>> insert  :use index for desired location

>>Removing an Item Using the del Statement
'''If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can use the del statement.'''
'''You can remove an item from any position in a list using the del statement if you know its index. For example, 
    here’s how to remove the second item, 'yamaha' , in the list:'''
'''In both examples, you can no longer access the value that was removed from the list after the del statement is used.'''

>>Removing an Item Using the pop() Method;          >pop is reciprocal to append (both works for end element by default):

'Sometimes you’ll want to use the value of an item after you remove.The pop() method removes the last item in a list, 
 but it lets you work with that item after removing it. The term pop comes from thinking of a list as a stack of items 
 and popping one item off the top of the stack. In this analogy, the top of a stack corresponds to the end of a list. 
 Let’s pop a motorcycle from the list of motorcycles:'''
>''How might this pop() method be useful? Imagine that the motorcycles in the list are stored in chronological order 
 according to when we owned them. If this is the case, we can use the pop() method to print a statement about the last motorcycle we bought:'''
Removing an Item by Value:
''won’t know the position of the value only know the value of the item you want to remove, you can use the remove() method. 
 For example, let’s say we want to remove the value 'ducati' from the list of motorcycles.'''
 You can also use the remove() method to work with a value that’s being removed from a list. Let’s remove the value 
 'ducati' and print a reason for removing it from the list:'''
The remove() method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. If there’s a possibility the value appears
more than once in the list, you’ll need to use a loop to determine if all occurrences of the value have been removed. You’ll 
learn how to do this in Chapter 7.'''

>>Making Numerical Lists: using range(initial value, one less to final value) function

if - statement:
>Checking for Equality: double equal sign ( == ). This equality operator returns True if the values on the left and right side of the operator match, 
 and False if they don’t match
>Checking for Inequality: an exclamation point and an equal sign ( != ). The exclamation represents not
>Numerical Comparisons: age= 19; >>> age< 21:True; >>> age<= 21:True;>>> age> 21: False; >>> age>= 21: False;
> Using and to Check Multiple Conditions
> age_0 = 22, age_1 = 18 >>> age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21: False
> age_1 = 22, age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21: True>>>(age_0 >= 21) and (age_1 >= 21)
>Checking Whether a Value Is in a List: 
> requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'onions', 'pineapple']
 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings: True
'pepperoni' in requested_toppings: False
>>if Statements:
 The if - else structure works well in situations in which you want Python to always execute one of two possible actions.
 In a simple if-else chain like this, one of the two actions will always be executed.
>>The if-elif-else Chain:
 Python’s if - elif - else syntax. Python executes only one block in an if - elif - else chain.
 It runs each conditional test in order until one passes. When a test passes, the code following that 
 test is executed and Python skips the rest of the tests.
>>Using Multiple elif Blocks:
 You can use as many elif blocks in your code as you like.
>>Omitting the else Block:
 The else block is a catchall statement. It matches any condition that wasn’t matched by a specific if or elif test,
 and that can sometimes include invalid or even malicious data. If you have a specific final condition you are
 testing for, consider using a final elif block and omit the else block. As a result, you’ll gain extra confidence
 that your code will run only under the correct conditions.
>>Testing Multiple Conditions:
 The if - elif - else chain is powerful, but it’s only appropriate to use when you just need one test to pass.
 As soon as Python finds one test that passes, it skips the rest of the tests. This behavior is beneficial, 
 because it’s efficient and allows you to test for one specific condition.
 However, sometimes it’s important to check all of the conditions of  interest. In this case, you should use a series
 of simple if statements with no elif or else blocks. This technique makes sense when more than one condition could be True,
 and you want to act on every condition that is True .
>>>In summary, if you want only one block of code to run, use an if - elif -else chain.
 If more than one block of code needs to run, use a series of independent if statements.

	"In this chapter I learned a bit about Python in general, and I installed Python to my system. 
     I installed a text editor to make it easier to write Python code. I learned to run snippets(small part) of 
     Python code in a terminal session, and I ran my first actual program,hello_world.py. I probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.
	In the next chapter I’ll learn about the different kinds of data I can work with in my Python programs, and I’ll learn to use variables as well."

Summary_chapter_02:
	"In this chapter you learned to work with variables. You learned to use descriptive variable names and 
   how to resolve name errors and syn- tax errors when they arise. You learned what strings are and how to
   display strings using lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase. You started using whitespace to organize output 
   neatly, and you learned to strip unneeded whitespace from different parts of a string. You started working
   with integers and floats, and you read about some unexpected behavior to watch out for when working with 
   numerical data. You also learned to write explanatory comments to make your code easier for you and others 
   to read. Finally, you read about the philosophy of keeping your code as simple as possible, whenever possible."
	In Chapter 3 you’ll learn to store collections of information in variables called lists. You’ll learn to 
   work through a list, manipulating any information in that list.

 "In this chapter I learned a bit about Python in general, and I installed Python to my system. I will look to 
  install a text editor to make it easier to write Python code. I learned to run snippets(small part) of Python 
  code in a terminal session, and I ran my first actual program, hello_world.py. I probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.
 In the next chapter I’ll learn about the different kinds of data I can work with in my Python programs, and I’ll learn to use variables as well."

Summary_chapter_03:
	In this chapter you learned what lists are and how to work with the individual items in a list. You learned 
  how to define a list and how to add and remove elements. You learned to sort lists permanently and temporarily 
  for display purposes. You also learned how to find the length of a list and how to avoid index errors when you’re working with lists.
In Chapter 4 you’ll learn how to work with items in a list more effi- ciently. By looping through each item in a
list using just a few lines of code you’ll be able to work efficiently, even when your list contains thousands or millions of items.

Summary_chapter_04:
	In this chapter you learned how to work efficiently with the elements in a  list. You learned how to work through 
  a list using a for loop, how Python  uses indentation to structure a program, and how to avoid some common
  indentation errors. You learned to make simple numerical lists, as well as a  few operations you can perform on 
  numerical lists. You learned how to slice a list to work with a subset of items and how to copy lists properly using a
  slice. You also learned about tuples, which provide a degree of protection to a set of values that shouldn’t change,
  and how to style your increasingly complex code to make it easy to read.
	In Chapter 5, you’ll learn to respond appropriately to different conditions by using if statements. You’ll learn 
  to string together relatively complex sets of conditional tests to respond appropriately to exactly the kind of 
  situation or information you’re looking for. You’ll also learn to use if statements while looping through a 
  list to take specific actions with selected elements from a list.
#tuple in an immutable list......

Summary_chapter_05:
    In this chapter you learned how to write conditional tests, which always evaluate to True or False . 
 You learned to write simple if statements, if - else chains, and if - elif - else chains. You began using these 
 structures to identify particular conditions you needed to test and to know when those conditions have been met in
 your programs. You learned to handle certain items in a list differently than all other items while continuing to 
 utilize the efficiency of a for loop. You also revisited Python’s style recommendations to ensure that your 
 increasingly complex programs are still relatively easy to read and understand. 
    In Chapter 6 you’ll learn about Python’s dictionaries. A dictionary is similar to a list, but it allows you to 
 connect pieces of information. You’ll learn to build dictionaries, loop through them, and use them in combination 
 with lists and if statements. Learning about dictionaries will enable you to model an even wider variety of real-world situations.
