What is Dickey-Fuller test used for?

In statistics, the Dickey–Fuller test tests the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in an autoregressive time series model. 
The alternative hypothesis is different depending on which version of the test is used, but is usually stationarity or trend-stationarity.



What is Dickey-Fuller test in time series?

Image result for dicky fullers test python.

Augmented Dickey Fuller test (ADF Test) is a common statistical test used to test whether a given Time series is stationary or not. 
It is one of the most commonly used statistical test when it comes to analyzing the stationary of a series.




What is the null hypothesis of the Augmented Dickey Fuller test?

The null hypothesis of DF test is that there is a unit root in an AR model, which implies that the data series is not stationary. 

The alternative hypothesis is generally stationarity or trend stationarity but can be different depending on the version of the test is being used.


What is p value in Dickey Fuller test?
The test has a specific distribution simply known as the Dickey–Fuller table for critical values. A key point to remember here is: Since the null hypothesis assumes the presence of a unit root, the p-value obtained by the test should be less than the significance level (say 0.05) to reject the null hypothesis.


How do I check if a data is stationary in Python?
Conclusions. Both tests can be used to check the stationarity of the data. 
The Rolling statistic test gives the pictorial representation while the dickey-fuller test gives some values which help to determine whether data is stationary or not


What should I do if my data is non-stationary?
The solution to the problem is to transform the time series data so that it becomes stationary. 
If the non-stationary process is a random walk with or without a drift, it is transformed to stationary process by differencing.



What is the difference between Dickey-Fuller test and augmented Dickey Fuller test?

The primary differentiator between the two tests is that the ADF is utilized for a larger and more complicated set of time series models. 
The augmented Dickey-Fuller statistic used in the ADF test is a negative number. 
The more negative it is, the stronger the rejection of the hypothesis that there is a unit root
