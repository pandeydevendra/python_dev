             TENSOR FLOW 2.0 (tensorflow 2.7.0)

In general, a lot of concepts in machine learning and deep learning can be abstracted
using multi-dimensional matrices â€“ tensors.
In math, tensors are described as geometric objects that describe linear relationships
between other geometric objects.

For the simplification of all concepts, tensors can be observed as multi-dimensional
arrays of data, ie. matrices.

When we observe them like n-dimensional arrays we can apply matrix operations easily and effectively.
That is what TensorFlow is actually doing.
In this framework, a tensor is a primitive unit and we can do various operations with them.
